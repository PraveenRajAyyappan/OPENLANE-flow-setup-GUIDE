# GUIDE FOR SETTING UP OPENSOURCE ANALOG AND DIGITAL(OpenLane) DESIGN INFRASTRUCTURE WITH SKY130NM PROCESS.

Please check the setup_analog.txt file, if you want to build only analog infrastructure.
Please check the setup.txt to build both analog with digital infrastructure. 

Note: The point of not presenting a seperate Digital setup is that setting up an Analog infrastructure after building Digital is very simple. It matter of just downloading certain tools. 

However, if an individual only need analog then it is quite different from the process of Digital installation. Because, the open_pdks and sky130A comes with the pdk installation in digital setup, but we need to install it seperately in the case og Analog setup.
